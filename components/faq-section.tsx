        "question": "What is Orange Sage and who is it for?",
        "answer": "Orange Sage is an AI-powered penetration testing platform designed for security teams, developers, and organizations who want to find and fix vulnerabilities before they reach production. It's perfect for teams seeking automated security testing that matches the quality of elite penetration testers."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Orange Sage's AI penetration testing work?",
        "answer": "Our AI agents run real attacks against your applications, just like human penetration testers. They scan APIs, web apps, networks, GitHub/GitLab code, and CI/CD pipelines, then provide validated findings with proof-of-concept exploits and detailed reports."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Orange Sage different from traditional security scanners?",
        "answer": "Unlike traditional scanners that produce false positives, Orange Sage validates every finding with actual exploits. It launches real-world attacks to confirm vulnerabilities exist, provides proof-of-concept scripts, and generates production-ready fixes automatically."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is Orange Sage compared to manual penetration testing?",
        "answer": "Orange Sage is 30Ã— faster than manual pentesting. What takes weeks with traditional methods can be completed in hours. Plus, it runs continuously 24/7, providing round-the-clock security monitoring."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of applications can Orange Sage test?",
        "answer": "Orange Sage provides complete coverage across APIs, web applications, networks, GitHub and GitLab repositories, and CI/CD pipelines. It can test any application or infrastructure component that needs security validation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my code and data secure with Orange Sage?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade security measures including end-to-end encryption and compliance with industry standards. For enterprise customers, we offer VPC and on-premises deployment options to ensure your sensitive data never leaves your environment."
